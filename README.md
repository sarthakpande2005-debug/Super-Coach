# Super-Coach
Personalized AI Exam Mentor for Shy/ Introverted Students


## Problem:
Many students, especially introverted or shy learners, face challenges in exam preparation:

  1. Difficulty in asking questions or seeking clarification.
  2. Lack of personalized study plans considering their strengths, weaknesses, and available time.
  3. Anxiety and stress due to unclear preparation strategies and lack of progress tracking.
  4. Overreliance on expensive coaching or scattered online resources without structured guidance.

## Data:
  1. In a study among secondary school students in Mysore District (100 students), 7% were “not so shy,” 79% were “moderately shy,” and 14% were “extremely shy.”.
  2. In NCERT survey (January - March 2022), 28% of students said they are hesitant in asking questions.
